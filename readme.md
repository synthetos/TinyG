TINYG EDGE BRANCH
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/synthetos/TinyG.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/synthetos/TinyG)

The edge branch is the work-in-process for the next stable release. Depending on the velocity of changes it's somewhere between alpha and beta. 
An attempt is made to keep everything working and usable, but there are no guarantees. Generally speaking, the edge branch should not be used for production uses - use the master branch instead.
