/*
 *	Coordinated motion (line drawing) is performed using a classic Bresenham DDA.
 *	A number of additional steps are taken to optimize interpolation and pulse train
 *	timing accuracy to minimize pulse jitter and make for very smooth motion and surface
 *	finish.
 *
 *    - The DDA is not used as a 'ramp' for acceleration management. Accel is computed
 *		upstream in the motion planner as 3rd order (controlled jerk) equations. These
 *		generate accel/decel segments that are passed to the DDA for step output.
 *
 *	  - The DDA accepts and processes fractional motor steps as floating point nuymbers
 *		from the planner. Steps do not need to be whole numbers, and are not expected to be.
 *		The step values are converted to integer by multiplying by a fixed-point precision
 *		(DDA_SUBSTEPS, 100000). Rounding is performed to avoid a truncation bias.
 *
 *    - Constant Rate DDA clock: The DDA runs at a constant, maximum rate for every
 *		segment regardless of actual step rate required. This means that the DDA clock
 *		is not tuned to the step rate (or a multiple) of the major axis, as is typical
 *		for most DDAs. Running the DDA flat out might appear to be "wasteful", but it ensures
 *		that the best aliasing results are achieved, and is part of maintaining step accuracy
 *		across motion segments.
 *
 *		The observation is that TinyG is a hard real-time system in which every clock cycle
 *		is knowable and can be accounted for. So if the system is capable of sustaining
 *		max pulse rate for the fastest move, it's capable of sustaining this rate for any
 *		move. So we just run it flat out and get the best pulse resolution for all moves.
 *		If we were running from batteries or otherwise cared about the energy budget we
 *		might not be so cavalier about this.
 *
 *		At 50 KHz constant clock rate we have 20 uSec between pulse timer (DDA) interrupts.
 *		On the Xmega we consume <10 uSec in the interrupt - a whopping 50% of available cycles
 *		going into pulse generation. On the ARM this is less of an issue, and we run a
 *		100 Khz (or higher) pulse rate.
 *
 *    - Pulse timing is also helped by minimizing the time spent loading the next move
 *		segment. The time budget for the load is less than the time remaining before the
 *		next DDA clock tick. This means that the load must take < 10 uSec or the time
 *		between pulses will stretch out when changing segments. This does not affect
 *		positional accuracy but it would affect jitter and smoothness. To this end as much
 *		as possible about that move is pre-computed during move execution (prep cycles).
 *		Also, all moves are loaded from the DDA interrupt level (HI), avoiding the need
 *		for mutual exclusion locking or volatiles (which slow things down).

/*
 **** Move generation overview and timing illustration ****
 *
 *	This ASCII art illustrates a 4 segment move to show stepper sequencing timing.
 *
 *    LOAD/STEP (~5000uSec)          [L1][segment1][L2][segment2][L3][segment3][L4][segment4][Lb1]
 *    PREP (100 uSec)            [P1]       [P2]          [P3]          [P4]          [Pb1]
 *    EXEC (400 uSec)         [EXEC1]    [EXEC2]       [EXEC3]       [EXEC4]       [EXECb1]
 *    PLAN (<4ms)  [planmoveA][plan move B][plan move C][plan move D][plan move E] etc.
 *
 *	The move begins with the planner PLANning move A [planmoveA]. When this is done the
 *	computations for the first segment of move A's S curve are performed by the planner
 *	runtime, EXEC1. The runtime computes the number of segments and the segment-by-segment
 *	accelerations and decelerations for the move. Each call to EXEC generates the values
 *	for the next segment to be run. Once the move is running EXEC is executed as a
 *	callback from the step loader.
 *
 *	When the runtime calculations are done EXEC calls the segment PREParation function [P1].
 *	PREP turns the EXEC results into values needed for the loader and does some encoder work.
 *	The combined exec and prep take about 400 uSec.
 *
 *	PREP takes care of heavy numerics and other cycle-intesive operations so the step loader
 *	L1 can run as fast as possible. The time budget for LOAD is about 10 uSec. In the diagram,
 *	when P1 is done segment 1 is loaded into the stepper runtime [L1]
 *
 *	Once the segment is loaded it will pulse out steps for the duration of the segment.
 *	Segment timing can vary, but segments take around 5 Msec to pulse out, which is 250 DDA
 *	ticks at a 50 KHz step clock.
 *
 *	Now the move is pulsing out segment 1 (at HI interrupt level). Once the L1 loader is
 *	finished it invokes the exec function for the next segment (at LO interrupt level).
 *	[EXEC2] and [P2] compute and prepare the segment 2 for the loader so it can be loaded
 *	as soon as segment 1 is complete [L2]. When move A is done EXEC pulls the next move
 *	(moveB) from the planner queue, The process repeats until there are no more segments or moves.
 *
 *	While all this is happening subsequent moves (B, C, and D) are being planned in background.
 *	As long as a move takes less than the segment times (5ms x N) the timing budget is satisfied,
 *
 *	A few things worth noting:
 *	  -	This scheme uses 2 interrupt levels and background, for 3 levels of execution:
 *		- STEP pulsing and LOADs occur at HI interrupt level
 *		- EXEC and PREP occur at LO interrupt level (leaving MED int level for serial IO)
 *		- move PLANning occurs in background and is managed by the controller
 *
 *	  -	Because of the way the timing is laid out there is no contention for resources between
 *		the STEP, LOAD, EXEC, and PREP phases. PLANing is similarly isolated. Very few volatiles
 *		or mutexes are needed, which makes the code simpler and faster. With the exception of
 *		the actual values used in step generation (which runs continuously) you can count on
 *		LOAD, EXEC, PREP and PLAN not stepping on each other's variables.
 */
/**** Line planning and execution (in more detail) ****
 *
 *	Move planning, execution and pulse generation takes place at 3 levels:
 *
 *	Move planning occurs in the main-loop. The canonical machine calls the planner to
 *	generate lines, arcs, dwells, synchronous stop/starts, and any other cvommand that
 *	needs to be syncronized wsith motion. The planner module generates blocks (bf's)
 *	that hold parameters for lines and the other move types. The blocks are backplanned
 *	to join lines and to take dwells and stops into account. ("plan" stage).
 *
 *	Arc movement is planned above the line planner. The arc planner generates short
 *	lines that are passed to the line planner.
 *
 *	Once lines are planned the must be broken up into "segments" of about 5 milliseconds
 *	to be run. These segments are how S curves are generated. This is the job of the move
 *	runtime (aka. exec or mr).
 *
 *	Move execution and load prep takes place at the LOW interrupt level. Move execution
 *	generates the next acceleration, cruise, or deceleration segment for planned lines,
 *	or just transfers parameters needed for dwells and stops. This layer also prepares
 *	segments for loading by pre-calculating the values needed by the DDA and converting
 *	the segment into parameters that can be directly loaded into the steppers ("exec"
 *	and "prep" stages).
 *
 *	Pulse train generation takes place at the HI interrupt level. The stepper DDA fires
 *	timer interrupts that generate the stepper pulses. This level also transfers new
 *	stepper parameters once each pulse train ("segment") is complete ("load" and "run" stages).
 */
/* 	What happens when the pulse generator is done with the current pulse train (segment)
 *	is a multi-stage "pull" queue that looks like this:
 *
 *	As long as the steppers are running the sequence of events is:
 *
 *	  - The stepper interrupt (HI) runs the DDA to generate a pulse train for the
 *		current move. This runs for the length of the pulse train currently executing
 *		- the "segment", usually 5ms worth of pulses
 *
 *	  - When the current segment is finished the stepper interrupt LOADs the next segment
 *		from the prep buffer, reloads the timers, and starts the next segment. At the end
 *		of the load the stepper interrupt routine requests an "exec" of the next move in
 *		order to prepare for the next load operation. It does this by calling the exec
 *		using a software interrupt (actually a timer, since that's all we've got).
 *
 *	  - As a result of the above, the EXEC handler fires at the LO interrupt level. It
 *		computes the next accel/decel or cruise (body) segment for the current move
 *		(i.e. the move in the planner's runtime buffer) by calling back to the exec
 *		routine in planner.c. If there are no more segments to run for the move the
 *		exec first gets the next buffer in the planning queue and begins execution.
 *
 *		In some cases the mext "move" is not actually a move, but a dewll, stop, IO
 *		operation (e.g. M5). In this case it executes the requested operation, and may
 *		attempt to get the next buffer from the planner when its done.
 *
 *	  - Once the segment has been computed the exec handler finshes up by running the
 *		PREP routine in stepper.c. This computes the DDA values and gets the segment
 *		into the prep buffer - and ready for the next LOAD operation.
 *
 *	  - The main loop runs in background to receive gcode blocks, parse them, and send
 *		them to the planner in order to keep the planner queue full so that when the
 *		planner's runtime buffer completes the next move (a gcode block or perhaps an
 *		arc segment) is ready to run.
 *
 *	If the steppers are not running the above is similar, except that the exec is
 *	invoked from the main loop by the software interrupt, and the stepper load is
 *	invoked from the exec by another software interrupt.
 */
/*	Control flow can be a bit confusing. This is a typical sequence for planning
 *	executing, and running an acceleration planned line:
 *
 *	 1  planner.mp_aline() is called, which populates a planning buffer (bf)
 *		and back-plans any pre-existing buffers.
 *
 *	 2  When a new buffer is added _mp_queue_write_buffer() tries to invoke
 *	    execution of the move by calling stepper.st_request_exec_move().
 *
 *	 3a If the steppers are running this request is ignored.
 *	 3b If the steppers are not running this will set a timer to cause an
 *		EXEC "software interrupt" that will ultimately call st_exec_move().
 *
 *   4  At this point a call to _exec_move() is made, either by the
 *		software interrupt from 3b, or once the steppers finish running
 *		the current segment and have loaded the next segment. In either
 *		case the call is initated via the EXEC software interrupt which
 *		causes _exec_move() to run at the MEDium interupt level.
 *
 *	 5	_exec_move() calls back to planner.mp_exec_move() which generates
 *		the next segment using the mr singleton.
 *
 *	 6	When this operation is complete mp_exec_move() calls the appropriate
 *		PREP routine in stepper.c to derive the stepper parameters that will
 *		be needed to run the move - in this example st_prep_line().
 *
 *	 7	st_prep_line() generates the timer and DDA values and stages these into
 *		the prep structure (sp) - ready for loading into the stepper runtime struct
 *
 *	 8	stepper.st_prep_line() returns back to planner.mp_exec_move(), which
 *		frees the planning buffer (bf) back to the planner buffer pool if the
 *		move is complete. This is done by calling _mp_request_finalize_run_buffer()
 *
 *	 9	At this point the MED interrupt is complete, but the planning buffer has
 *		not actually been returned to the pool yet. The buffer will be returned
 *		by the main-loop prior to testing for an available write buffer in order
 *		to receive the next Gcode block. This handoff prevents possible data
 *		conflicts between the interrupt and main loop.
 *
 *	10	The final step in the sequence is _load_move() requesting the next
 *		segment to be executed and prepared by calling st_request_exec()
 *		- control goes back to step 4.
 *
 *	Note: For this to work you have to be really careful about what structures
 *	are modified at what level, and use volatiles where necessary.
 */
/* Partial steps and phase angle compensation
 *
 *	The DDA accepts partial steps as input. Fractional steps are managed by the
 *	sub-step value as explained elsewhere. The fraction initially loaded into
 *	the DDA and the remainder left at the end of a move (the "residual") can
 *	be thought of as a phase angle value for the DDA accumulation. Each 360
 *	degrees of phase angle results in a step being generated.

 *	DDA Substepping is a fixed.point scheme to increase the resolution of the DDA pulse generation

 *

 *	number range. Variables are:
 *
 *		MAX_LONG == 2^31, maximum signed long (depth of accumulator. NB: accumulator values are negative)
 *		FREQUENCY_DDA == DDA clock rate in Hz.
 *		NOM_SEGMENT_TIME == upper bound of segment time in minutes
 *		0.90 == a safety factor used to reduce the result from theoretical maximum
 *
 *	The number is about 8.5 million for the Xmega running a 50 KHz DDA with 5 millisecond segments
 *	The ARM is about 1/4 that (or less) as the DDA clock rate is 4x higher. Decreasing the nominal

 *	is how much. The holdoff is how many segments to wait before applying another correction. If threshold
