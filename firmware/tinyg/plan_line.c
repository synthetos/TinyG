	// the time to decelerate from the target velocity to zero would be the longest.
	//
	//	We can determine the "longest" deceleration in terms of time or distance.
	//
	//  The math for time-to-decelerate T from speed S to speed E with constant
	//  jerk J is:
	//
	//		T = 2*sqrt((S-E)/J[n])
	//
	//	Since E is always zero in this calculation, we can simplify:
	//		T = 2*sqrt(S/J[n])
	//
	//	The math for distance-to-decelerate l from speed S to speed E with constant
	//  jerk J is:
	//
	//		l = (S+E)*sqrt((S-E)/J)
	//
	//	Since E is always zero in this calculation, we can simplify:
	//		l = S*sqrt(S/J)
	//
	//  The final value we want is to know which one is *longest*, compared to the others,
	//	so we don't need the actual value. This means that the scale of the value doesn't
	//	matter, so for T we can remove the "2 *" and For L we can remove the "S*".
	//	This leaves both to be simply "sqrt(S/J)". Since we don't need the scale,
	//	it doesn't matter what speed we're coming from, so S can be replaced with 1.
	//
	//  However, we *do* need to compensate for the fact that each axis contributes
	//	differently to the move, so we will scale each contribution C[n] by the
	//	proportion of the axis movement length D[n] to the total length of the move L.
	//	Using that, we construct the following, with these definitions:
	//
	//		J[n] = max_jerk for axis n
	//		D[n] = distance traveled for this move for axis n
	//		L = total length of the move in all axes
	//		C[n] = "axis contribution" of axis n
	//
	// For each axis n: C[n] = sqrt(1/J[n]) * (D[n]/L)
	//
	//	Keeping in mind that we only need a rank compared to the other axes, we can further
	//	optimize the calculations::
	//
	//	Square the expression to remove the square root:
	//		C[n]^2 = (1/J[n]) * (D[n]/L)^2	(We don't care the C is squared, we'll use it that way.)
	//
	//	Re-arranged to optimize divides for pre-calculated values, we create a value
	//  M that we compute once:
	//		M = (1/(L^2))
	//  Then we use it in the calculations for every axis:
	//		C[n] = (1/J[n]) * D[n]^2 * M
	//
	//  Also note that we already have (1/J[n]) calculated for each axis, which simplifies it further.
	//
	// Finally, the selected jerk term needs to be scaled by the reciprocal of the absolute value
	// of the jerk-limit axis's unit vector term. This way when the move is finally decomposed into
	// its constituent axes for execution the jerk for that axis will be at it's maximum value.

 * _calc_move_times() - compute optimal and minimum move times into the gcode_state
 *
 *	"Minimum time" is the fastest the move can be performed given the velocity constraints on each
 *	participating axis - regardless of the feed rate requested. The minimum time is the time limited
 *	by the rate-limiting axis. The minimum time is needed to compute the optimal time and is
 *	recorded for possible feed override computation..
 *
 *	"Optimal time" is either the time resulting from the requested feed rate or the minimum time if
 *	the requested feed rate is not achievable. Optimal times for traverses are always the minimum time.
 *
 *	The gcode state must have targets set prior by having cm_set_target(). Axis modes are taken into
 *	account by this.
 *
 *	The following times are compared and the longest is returned:
 *	  -	G93 inverse time (if G93 is active)
 *	  -	time for coordinated move at requested feed rate
 *	  -	time that the slowest axis would require for the move
 *
 *	Sets the following variables in the gcode_state struct
 *	  - move_time is set to optimal time
 *	  - minimum_time is set to minimum time

/* --- NIST RS274NGC_v3 Guidance ---
 *
 *	The following is verbatim text from NIST RS274NGC_v3. As I interpret A for moves that
 *	combine both linear and rotational movement, the feed rate should apply to the XYZ
 *	movement, with the rotational axis (or axes) timed to start and end at the same time
 *	the linear move is performed. It is possible under this case for the rotational move
 *	to rate-limit the linear move.
 *
 * 	2.1.2.5 Feed Rate
 *
 *	The rate at which the controlled point or the axes move is nominally a steady rate
 *	which may be set by the user. In the Interpreter, the interpretation of the feed
 *	rate is as follows unless inverse time feed rate mode is being used in the
 *	RS274/NGC view (see Section 3.5.19). The canonical machining functions view of feed
 *	rate, as described in Section 4.3.5.1, has conditions under which the set feed rate
 *	is applied differently, but none of these is used in the Interpreter.
 *
 *	A. 	For motion involving one or more of the X, Y, and Z axes (with or without
 *		simultaneous rotational axis motion), the feed rate means length units per
 *		minute along the programmed XYZ path, as if the rotational axes were not moving.
 *
 *	B.	For motion of one rotational axis with X, Y, and Z axes not moving, the
 *		feed rate means degrees per minute rotation of the rotational axis.
 *
 *	C.	For motion of two or three rotational axes with X, Y, and Z axes not moving,
 *		the rate is applied as follows. Let dA, dB, and dC be the angles in degrees
 *		through which the A, B, and C axes, respectively, must move.
 *		Let D = sqrt(dA^2 + dB^2 + dC^2). Conceptually, D is a measure of total
 *		angular motion, using the usual Euclidean metric. Let T be the amount of
 *		time required to move through D degrees at the current feed rate in degrees
 *		per minute. The rotational axes should be moved in coordinated linear motion
 *		so that the elapsed time from the start to the end of the motion is T plus
 *		any time required for acceleration or deceleration.

 *
 *	_plan_block_list() plans all blocks between and including the (effective) first block
 *	and the bf. It sets entry, exit and cruise v's from vmax's then calls trapezoid generation.
 *

 *
 *	  bf (function arg)		- end of block list (last block in time)
 *	  bf->replannable		- start of block list set by last FALSE value [Note 1]
 *	  bf->block_type		- typically BLOCK_TYPE_ALINE. Other block_types should be set to
 *							  length=0, entry_vmax=0 and exit_vmax=0 and are treated
 *							  as a momentary stop (plan to zero and from zero).
 *
 *	  bf->length			- provides block length
 *	  bf->entry_vmax		- used during forward planning to set entry velocity
 *	  bf->cruise_vmax		- used during forward planning to set cruise velocity

 * _get_junction_vmax() - Sonny's algorithm - simple
 *
 *  Computes the maximum allowable junction speed by finding the velocity that will yield
 *	the centripetal acceleration in the corner_acceleration value. The value of delta sets
 *	the effective radius of curvature. Here's Sonny's (Sungeun K. Jeon's) explanation
 *	of what's going on:
 *
 *	"First let's assume that at a junction we only look a centripetal acceleration to simply
 *	things. At a junction of two lines, let's place a circle such that both lines are tangent
 *	to the circle. The circular segment joining the lines represents the path for constant
 *	centripetal acceleration. This creates a deviation from the path (let's call this delta),
 *	which is the distance from the junction to the edge of the circular segment. Delta needs
 *	to be defined, so let's replace the term max_jerk (see note 1) with max_junction_deviation,
 *	or "delta". This indirectly sets the radius of the circle, and hence limits the velocity
 *	by the centripetal acceleration. Think of the this as widening the race track. If a race
 *	car is driving on a track only as wide as a car, it'll have to slow down a lot to turn
 *	corners. If we widen the track a bit, the car can start to use the track to go into the
 *	turn. The wider it is, the faster through the corner it can go.
 *
 * (Note 1: "max_jerk" refers to the old grbl/marlin max_jerk" approximation term, not the
 *	tinyG jerk terms)
 *
 *	If you do the geometry in terms of the known variables, you get:
 *		sin(theta/2) = R/(R+delta)  Re-arranging in terms of circle radius (R)
 *		R = delta*sin(theta/2)/(1-sin(theta/2).
 *
 *	Theta is the angle between line segments given by:
 *		cos(theta) = dot(a,b)/(norm(a)*norm(b)).
 *
 *	Most of these calculations are already done in the planner. To remove the acos()
 *	and sin() computations, use the trig half angle identity:
 *		sin(theta/2) = +/- sqrt((1-cos(theta))/2).
 *
 *	For our applications, this should always be positive. Now just plug the equations into
 *	the centripetal acceleration equation: v_c = sqrt(a_max*R). You'll see that there are
 *	only two sqrt computations and no sine/cosines."
 *
 *	How to compute the radius using brute-force trig:
 *		float theta = acos(costheta);
 *		float radius = delta * sin(theta/2)/(1-sin(theta/2));
 */
/*  This version extends Chamnit's algorithm by computing a value for delta that takes
 *	the contributions of the individual axes in the move into account. This allows the
 *	control radius to vary by axis. This is necessary to support axes that have
 *	different dynamics; such as a Z axis that doesn't move as fast as X and Y (such as a
 *	screw driven Z axis on machine with a belt driven XY - like a Shapeoko), or rotary
 *	axes ABC that have completely different dynamics than their linear counterparts.
 *
 *	The function takes the absolute values of the sum of the unit vector components as
 *	a measure of contribution to the move, then scales the delta values from the non-zero
 *	axes into a composite delta to be used for the move. Shown for an XY vector:
 *
 *	 	U[i]	Unit sum of i'th axis	fabs(unit_a[i]) + fabs(unit_b[i])
 *	 	Usum	Length of sums			Ux + Uy
 *	 	d		Delta of sums			(Dx*Ux+DY*UY)/Usum
