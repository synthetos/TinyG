/**** ALINE EXECUTION ROUTINES *******************************************/
/*************************************************************************
 * ---> Everything here fires from interrupts and must be interrupt safe
 *
 *  _exec_aline()		  - acceleration line main routine
 *	_exec_aline_head()	  - helper for acceleration section
 *	_exec_aline_body()	  - helper for cruise section
 *	_exec_aline_tail()	  - helper for deceleration section
 *	_exec_aline_segment() - helper for running a segment
 *
 *	Returns:
 *	 STAT_OK		move is done
 *	 STAT_EAGAIN	move is not finished - has more segments to run
 *	 STAT_NOOP		cause no operation from the steppers - do not load the move
 *	 STAT_xxxxx		fatal error. Ends the move and frees the bf buffer
 *
 *	This routine is called from the (LO) interrupt level. The interrupt
 *	sequencing relies on the behaviors of the routines being exactly correct.
 *	Each call to _exec_aline() must execute and prep *one and only one*
 *	segment. If the segment is the not the last segment in the bf buffer the
 *	_aline() must return STAT_EAGAIN. If it's the last segment it must return
 *	STAT_OK. If it encounters a fatal error that would terminate the move it
 *	should return a valid error code. Failure to obey this will introduce
 *	subtle and very difficult to diagnose bugs (trust me on this).
 *
 *	Note 1 Returning STAT_OK ends the move and frees the bf buffer.
 *		   Returning STAT_OK at this point does NOT advance position meaning any
 *		   position error will be compensated by the next move.
 *
 *	Note 2 Solves a potential race condition where the current move ends but the
 * 		   new move has not started because the previous move is still being run
 *		   by the steppers. Planning can overwrite the new move.

/* OPERATION:
 *	Aline generates jerk-controlled S-curves as per Ed Red's course notes:
 *	  http://www.et.byu.edu/~ered/ME537/Notes/Ch5.pdf
 *	  http://www.scribd.com/doc/63521608/Ed-Red-Ch5-537-Jerk-Equations
 *
 *	A full trapezoid is divided into 5 periods Periods 1 and 2 are the
 *	first and second halves of the acceleration ramp (the concave and convex
 *	parts of the S curve in the "head"). Periods 3 and 4 are the first
 *	and second parts of the deceleration ramp (the tail). There is also
 *	a period for the constant-velocity plateau of the trapezoid (the body).
 *	There are various degraded trapezoids possible, including 2 section
 *	combinations (head and tail; head and body; body and tail), and single
 *	sections - any one of the three.
 *
 *	The equations that govern the acceleration and deceleration ramps are:
 *
 *	  Period 1	  V = Vi + Jm*(T^2)/2
 *	  Period 2	  V = Vh + As*T - Jm*(T^2)/2
 *	  Period 3	  V = Vi - Jm*(T^2)/2
 *	  Period 4	  V = Vh + As*T + Jm*(T^2)/2
 *
 * 	These routines play some games with the acceleration and move timing
 *	to make sure this actually all works out. move_time is the actual time of the
 *	move, accel_time is the time valaue needed to compute the velocity - which
 *	takes the initial velocity into account (move_time does not need to).

/* Forward difference math explained:
 *
 *	We are using a quintic (fifth-degree) Bezier polynomial for the velocity curve.
 *	This gives us a "linear pop" velocity curve; with pop being the sixth derivative of position:
 *	velocity - 1st, acceleration - 2nd, jerk - 3rd, snap - 4th, crackle - 5th, pop - 6th
 *
 * The Bezier curve takes the form:
 *
 *  V(t) = P_0 * B_0(t) + P_1 * B_1(t) + P_2 * B_2(t) + P_3 * B_3(t) + P_4 * B_4(t) + P_5 * B_5(t)
 *
 * Where 0 <= t <= 1, and V(t) is the velocity. P_0 through P_5 are the control points, and B_0(t)
 * through B_5(t) are the Bernstein basis as follows:
 *
 *		B_0(t) =   (1-t)^5        =   -t^5 +  5t^4 - 10t^3 + 10t^2 -  5t   +   1
 *		B_1(t) =  5(1-t)^4 * t    =   5t^5 - 20t^4 + 30t^3 - 20t^2 +  5t
 *		B_2(t) = 10(1-t)^3 * t^2  = -10t^5 + 30t^4 - 30t^3 + 10t^2
 *		B_3(t) = 10(1-t)^2 * t^3  =  10t^5 - 20t^4 + 10t^3
 *		B_4(t) =  5(1-t)   * t^4  =  -5t^5 +  5t^4
 *		B_5(t) =             t^5  =    t^5
 *		                              ^       ^       ^       ^       ^       ^
 *		                              |       |       |       |       |       |
 *		                              A       B       C       D       E       F
 *
 *
 *  We use forward-differencing to calculate each position through the curve.
 *	This requires a formula of the form:
 *
 *		V_f(t) = A*t^5 + B*t^4 + C*t^3 + D*t^2 + E*t + F
 *
 *  Looking at the above B_0(t) through B_5(t) expanded forms, if we take the coefficients of t^5
 *  through t of the Bezier form of V(t), we can determine that:
 *
 *		A =    -P_0 +  5*P_1 - 10*P_2 + 10*P_3 -  5*P_4 +  P_5
 *		B =   5*P_0 - 20*P_1 + 30*P_2 - 20*P_3 +  5*P_4
 *		C = -10*P_0 + 30*P_1 - 30*P_2 + 10*P_3
 *		D =  10*P_0 - 20*P_1 + 10*P_2
 *		E = - 5*P_0 +  5*P_1
 *		F =     P_0
 *
 *	Now, since we will (currently) *always* want the initial acceleration and jerk values to be 0,
 *	We set P_i = P_0 = P_1 = P_2 (initial velocity), and P_t = P_3 = P_4 = P_5 (target velocity),
 *	which, after simplification, resolves to:
 *
 *		A = - 6*P_i +  6*P_t
 *		B =  15*P_i - 15*P_t
 *		C = -10*P_i + 10*P_t
 *		D = 0
 *		E = 0
 *		F = P_i
 *
 *	Given an interval count of I to get from P_i to P_t, we get the parametric "step" size of h = 1/I.
 *	We need to calculate the initial value of forward differences (F_0 - F_5) such that the inital
 *	velocity V = P_i, then we iterate over the following I times:
 *
 *		V   += F_5
 *		F_5 += F_4
 *		F_4 += F_3
 *		F_3 += F_2
 *		F_2 += F_1
 *
 *	See http://www.drdobbs.com/forward-difference-calculation-of-bezier/184403417 for an example of
 *	how to calculate F_0 - F_5 for a cubic bezier curve. Since this is a quintic bezier curve, we
 *	need to extend the formulas somewhat. I'll not go into the long-winded step-by-step here,
 *	but it gives the resulting formulas:
 *
 *		a = A, b = B, c = C, d = D, e = E, f = F
 *		F_5(t+h)-F_5(t) = (5ah)t^4 + (10ah^2 + 4bh)t^3 + (10ah^3 + 6bh^2 + 3ch)t^2 +
 *			(5ah^4 + 4bh^3 + 3ch^2 + 2dh)t + ah^5 + bh^4 + ch^3 + dh^2 + eh
 *
 *		a = 5ah
 *		b = 10ah^2 + 4bh
 *		c = 10ah^3 + 6bh^2 + 3ch
 *		d = 5ah^4 + 4bh^3 + 3ch^2 + 2dh
 *
 *  (After substitution, simplification, and rearranging):
 *		F_4(t+h)-F_4(t) = (20ah^2)t^3 + (60ah^3 + 12bh^2)t^2 + (70ah^4 + 24bh^3 + 6ch^2)t +
 *			30ah^5 + 14bh^4 + 6ch^3 + 2dh^2
 *
 *		a = (20ah^2)
 *		b = (60ah^3 + 12bh^2)
 *		c = (70ah^4 + 24bh^3 + 6ch^2)
 *
 *  (After substitution, simplification, and rearranging):
 *		F_3(t+h)-F_3(t) = (60ah^3)t^2 + (180ah^4 + 24bh^3)t + 150ah^5 + 36bh^4 + 6ch^3
 *
 *  (You get the picture...)
 *		F_2(t+h)-F_2(t) = (120ah^4)t + 240ah^5 + 24bh^4
 *		F_1(t+h)-F_1(t) = 120ah^5
 *

 *		F_4 = (165Ah^5)/2 + 29Bh^4 + 9Ch^3 + 2Dh^2
 *		F_3 = 255Ah^5 + 48Bh^4 + 6Ch^3
 *		F_2 = 300Ah^5 + 24Bh^4
 *		F_1 = 120Ah^5
 *
 *  Note that with our current control points, D and E are actually 0.
