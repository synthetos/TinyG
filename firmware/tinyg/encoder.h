/*
 * ENCODERS
 *
 *	Calling this file "encoders" is kind of a lie, at least for now. There are no encoders.
 *	Instead the steppers count steps to provide a "truth" reference for position. In the
 *	future when we have real encoders we'll stop counting steps and actually measure the
 *	position. Which should be a lot easier than how this module currently works.
 *
 *	*** Measuring position ***
 *
 *	The challenge is that you can't just measure the position at any arbitrary point
 *	because the system is so heavily queued (pipelined) by the planner queue and the stepper
 *	sequencing.
 *
 *	You only know where the machine should be at known "targets", which are at the end of
 *	each move section (end of head, body, and tail). You need to take encoder readings at
 *	these points. This synchronization is taken care of by the Target, Position, Position_delayed
 *	sequence in plan_exec. Referring to ASCII art in stepper.h and reproduced here:
 *
 *  LOAD/STEP (~5000uSec)          [L1][Segment1][L2][Segment2][L3][Segment3][L4][Segment4][Lb1][Segmentb1]
 *  PREP (100 uSec)            [P1]       [P2]          [P3]          [P4]          [Pb1]          [Pb2]
 *  EXEC (400 uSec)         [EXEC1]    [EXEC2]       [EXEC3]       [EXEC4]       [EXECb1]       [EXECb2]
 *  PLAN (<4ms)  [PLANmoveA][PLANmoveB][PLANmoveC][PLANmoveD][PLANmoveE] etc.
 *
 *	You can collect the target for moveA as early as the end of [PLANmoveA]. The system will
 *	not reach that target position until the end of [Segment4]. Data from Segment4 can only be
 *	processed during the EXECb2 or Pb2 interval as it's the first time that is not time-critical
 *	and you actually have enough cycles to calculate the position and error terms. We use Pb2.
 *
 *	Additionally, by this time the target in Gcode model knows about has advanced quite a bit,
 *	so the moveA target needs to be saved somewhere. Targets are propagated downward to the planner
 *	runtime (the EXEC), but the exec will have moved on to moveB by the time we need it. So moveA's
 *	target needs to be saved somewhere.
 */
/*
 * ERROR CORRECTION
 *
 *	The purpose of this module is to calculate an error term between the programmed
 *	position (target) and the actual measured position (position). The error term is
 *	used during move execution (exec) to adjust the move to compensate for accumulated
 *	positional errors. It's also the basis of closed-loop (servoed) systems.
 *
 *	Positional error occurs due to floating point numerical inaccuracies. TinyG uses
 *	32 bit floating point (GCC 32 bit, which is NOT IEEE 32 bit). Errors creep in
 *	during planning, move execution, and stepper output phases. Care has been taken
 *	to minimize introducing errors throughout the process, but they still occur.
 *	In most cases errors are not noticeable as they fall below the step resolution
 *	for most jobs. For jobs that run > 1 hour the errors can accumulate and send
 *	results off by as much as a millimeter if not corrected.
 *
 *	Note: Going to doubles (from floats) would reduce the errors but not eliminate
 *	them altogether. But this moot on AVRGCC which only does single precision floats.
 *
 *	*** Applying the error term for error correction ***
 *
 *	So if you want to use the error from moveA to correct moveB it has to be done in a region that
 *	is not already running (i.e. the head, body, or tail) as moveB is already 2 segments into run.
 *	Since most moves in very short line Gcode files are body only, for practical purposes the
 *	correction will be applied to moveC. (It's possible to recompute the body of moveB, but it may
 *	not be worth the trouble).
