 * kn_inverse_kinematics() - wrapper routine for inverse kinematics
 *
 *	Calls kinematics function(s).
 *	Performs axis mapping & conversion of length units to steps (and deals with inhibited axes)
 *
 *	The reason steps are returned as floats (as opposed to, say, uint32_t) is to accommodate
 *	fractional DDA steps. The DDA deals with fractional step values as fixed-point binary in
 *	order to get the smoothest possible operation. Steps are passed to the move prep routine
 *	as floats and converted to fixed-point binary during queue loading. See stepper.c for details.

 * _inverse_kinematics() - inverse kinematics - example is for a cartesian machine
 *
 *	You can glue in inverse kinematics here, but be aware of time budget constraints.
 *	This function is run during the _exec() portion of the cycle and will therefore
 *	be run once per interpolation segment. The total time for the segment load,
 *	including the inverse kinematics transformation cannot exceed the segment time,
 *	and ideally should be no more than 25-50% of the segment time. Currently segments
 *	run every 1.5 ms, but this might be lowered. To profile this time look at the
 *	time it takes to complete the mp_exec_move() function.
 *
 *	Note: the compiler will  inline trivial functions (like memcpy) so there is no
 *	size or performance penalty for breaking this out
